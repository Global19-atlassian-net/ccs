## What happened to unanimity?
Unanimity lives on as a PacBio internal library to generate consensus sequences.
Documentation will be limited to _ccs_ distributed via bioconda.

## Where is the source code?
We have stopped mirroring code changes to GitHub in March 2018.
Instead, we provide binaries on bioconda to ease end-user experience.
If your project relies on outdated unanimity source code,
please use [this commit](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/unanimity/tree/6f11a13e1472b8c00337ba8c5e94bf83bdab31d6).
