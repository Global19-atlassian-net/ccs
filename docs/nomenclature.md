# Nomenclature
CLR
 : Continuous Long Reads, multiple subreads (readouts) of the same DNA molecule

CCS
 : The single-molecule consensus application, consuming multiple subreads per ZMW

Arrow
 : The algorithm for polishing, a hidden Markov model

CCS reads
 : Generated by the CCS application

HiFi reads
 : CCS Reads with predicted accuracy â‰¥ Q20

Kinetics
 : Per base IPD (interpulse duration) and PW (pulse width)
